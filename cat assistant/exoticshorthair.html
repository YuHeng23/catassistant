                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>Exotic shorthairs are incredibly simple to groom, unlike Persians. Exotic shorthairs are soft, medium-sized cats with charming personalities who often form close relationships with their owners. They also get along well with other animals and children. Even while exotic shorthairs don't require a lot of energy or activity, they will happily play with toys like fishing pole feather teasers or other similar items for hours. The Persian is currently the most common purebred shorthair cat, with the exotic shorthair coming in second. They can be as much as 6.8 kilogramme</p>

                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Exotic shorthairs can thrive in a variety of settings and don't need a lot of active engagement or stimulation because they have less energy than many other cats. The exotic shorthair cat is the ideal choice for calm families and first-time cat owners due to its charming, laid-back, and playful demeanour as well as its low maintenance grooming and exercise requirements. The exotic shorthair is a wonderful companion for just about everyone who doesn't need an active playmate because of its caring, devoted, and tranquil demeanour.</p>
                    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                    <p>Up to 15 years</p>
                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The exotic shorthair and Persian are bred to the same standards, while having quite distinct coats. Exotic shorthairs have short legs, small ears, and flattened features. The exotic's coat is short, dense, and silky, unlike the Persian's.</p>
