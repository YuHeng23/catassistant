                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>Abyssinians are extremely intelligent and incredibly curious. They are intrepid and will explore every nook and crevice. Because of their propensity to seize anything that catch their eye, they are frequently referred to as "Aby-grabbys". The exuberant Aby enjoys climbing and jumping. Have a selection of toys on hand to keep her amused, including brain-testing puzzle toys. Males weigh 3.17 to 4.5 kg, while females weigh 2.72 to 3.62 kg. They are small to medium-sized, and their colours include ruddy, red, blue, and fawn.</p>
                            <p>An active family is a great fit for the Abyssinian. However, it is advised to give your Aby a companion cat because they are very social and can get bored if left alone for an extended period of time.</p>

                    <p>It seems to be constantly moving, yet occasionally she will stop and curl up next to you on the couch or in bed. Even though it is independent, it functions best when it has a fellow Abyssinian buddy to match its high levels of activity while you are away. Abyssinians enjoy receiving attention from you. They also get along well with dogs that are cat-friendly and other animals like big parrots and ferrets.</p>
                    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                    <p>9 to 15 years</p>
                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
