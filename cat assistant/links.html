                            <p>In the United States, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) was founded in 1906. The CFA presently maintains the largest database of purebred cats in existence. The association's declared goals are to preserve and advance purebred cat breeds while simultaneously improving the welfare of all cats. Along with its well-established operation in the United States and Canada, the association presently has a recognised presence in Europe, China, and Japan. Their website provides many detailed information about breeds that are certified by this organization.</p>
                            <p>Aside from promoting their association, it also provides various breeding services that users can set the breeds they prefer and the location the user is in, information about the breeds that are recognized by the association that are eligible for the household pet class, and also advice about caring about cats and building a cattery, which are useful for cat owners.</p>
