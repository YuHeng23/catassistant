                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>The British shorthair cat breed has some level of popularity. The British shorthair cat is a medium- to large-sized breed of cat that has a short, dense coat and a recognisable rounded head and face that resembles a cuddly teddy bear. British shorthair cats are kind and loving without becoming overly dependent or clingy. This breed originated in the United Kingdom, where it naturally evolved into the first domestic shorthaired cat in the country. British shorthairs exist in a real rainbow of colours and patterns today, including solid, bicolor, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and more. Originally, many of them were blue in colour (a greyish hue). They weigh between 3.17 kg to 7.7 kg.</p>

                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Even as adults, British Shorthairs are lively, although they are not overly energetic. By exploring the house and playing with you a few times a day, they can receive enough of exercise. Use feather wands, toy mice, and any other favourite toys to engage your British Shorthair.</p>
                    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                    <p>12 to 15 years</p>
                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The British shorthair is a wonderful family catâ€”the breed has an easy-going personality and generally gets along with everyone, including kids and other animals living in the house. They are active without being hyper, tend to be quiet, and can live happily in almost any size house, including apartments. </p>
