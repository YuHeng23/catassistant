                            <h1>Scottish Fold</h1>
                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>The Scottish fold cat is a friendly, short-haired breed with folded ears, which is how it got its peculiar name. The cat has unusual ears that fold forward and downward, giving it an owl-like appearance. The Scottish barn cat that contained the defective gene that served as the foundation for the breed is where the trait first appeared. It is kind, lovable, and suitable for most households. Unfortunately, a painful skeletal disorder is also linked to the gene causing folded ears. Many people adore this curious-looking, loving, and attentive cat. It can be as much as 4.9 kilogrammes.</p>

                <div class="cat-info">
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>This breed is renowned for its laid-back personality and all-around sociability. It typically gets along well with other cats, cat-friendly dogs, and households with many pets. The Scottish fold, whose loving attitude is both soothing and endearing to people of all ages, will quickly become friends with children who are old enough to respect this cat and not handle it violently. The Scottish fold will thrive in a home where casual play is balanced with plenty of peaceful cuddle time. It doesn't need a lot of physical involvement or severe exercise to be happy.</p>
                    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                    <p>Up to 14 years</p>
                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The most distinctive characteristic of a Scottish fold cat is its folded ears, but it also has a noticeably spherical shape in general. With stocky legs and a relatively stubby tail that emphasise the cat's general roundness, both its head and body have a tendency to be fairly orb-shaped. They have enormous, nearly round eyes. Scottish folds are medium-sized cats with coats that come in a range of hues and patterns. They are more likely to have short, dense hair than long hair.</p>
