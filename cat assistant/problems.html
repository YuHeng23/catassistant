                            <p>A group of disorders known as cancer are characterised by uncontrollable cell growth, invasion of nearby tissue, and potential body-wide dissemination. Cats can develop many forms of cancer, much as people. A tumor-like localised disease or a more widespread condition can exist (spread throughout the body).</p>
                            <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                            <p>LSA, also known as lymphosarcoma or lymphoma, is one of the most prevalent cancers in cats. According to some statistics, LSA is responsible for 30% of all recorded feline cancer cases. Except for the gastrointestinal (GI) variant, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is associated with the majority of forms of LSA. A transmissible retrovirus called FeLV can spread by direct touch, saliva, and even in utero. The virus, which primarily affects younger cats, doesn't always show symptoms, so it's crucial to have your cat tested regularly to stop transmission and development. Based on your cat's lifestyle and risk of exposure to FeLV, your veterinarian can talk to you about a FeLV vaccine.</p>
                            <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
                            <p>Lumps (which are not always malignant, but are always worth having a veterinarian examine),

                                <p><b>Definition</b></p>
                                <p>A cat's immune system can be severely suppressed by the transmittable RNA retrovirus known as feline leukaemia virus. It is one of the most often recognised diseases and fatalities in domestic cats. FeLV testing should be done on any sick cat as well as any new cat entering the family because the virus doesn't often show signs straight away. FeLV impairs an animal's immune system and makes cats more vulnerable to infections and illnesses, including renal disease, anaemia, and lymphosarcoma, a deadly tumour of the lymphatic system.</p>
                                <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                                <p>The cats most at risk for infection are those who live with sick cats, go outside where they can get bitten by infected cats, and have kittens from mothers that have the FeLV virus. Direct contact, mutual grooming, and sharing of litter boxes, water bowls, and food dishes are the most typical ways that FeLV is spread. Fighting outdoor cats that are infected might spread the illness to other cats through bites and scratches.</p>
                                <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

                                <p><b>Definition</b></p>
                                <p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats may not exhibit symptoms for several years following the first infection. Even though the virus takes time to manifest, once it does, a cat's immune system is severely compromised. The cat is now more vulnerable to a number of secondary infections. Before the illness progresses to its chronic stages, infected cats can lead relatively comfortable lives for months or years when they receive supportive medical care and are kept in a stress-free, indoor environment.</p>
                                <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                                <p>A great reason to keep your cat inside is because FIV is mostly transmitted from cat to cat through deep bite wounds, the kind that typically happen outside during fierce fights and territorial disputes. A different, less frequent method of transmission is from a mother cat with FIV to her youngster. Sharing food bowls and litter boxes, social grooming, sneezing, and other inconspicuous forms of interaction do not appear to be prevalent ways for FIV to spread.</p>

                                <p><b>Definition</b></p>
                                <p>Ringworm is not caused by a worm at all, despite what the name might imply. Rather, it is brought on by a fungus that can affect the skin, hair, and nails. This very contagious illness can cause uneven, circular patches of hair loss with core red rings, which are not unusual in cats. Ringworm, also known as dermatophytosis, frequently spreads to other household pets as well as to people.</p>
                                <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                                <p>Direct contact with an infected animal can cause ringworm in cats, as can indirect contact with bedding, plates, and other items that have been contaminated with the skin cells or hair of infected animals. In crowded areas like shelters, ringworm may spread very quickly. Infections of ringworm are more likely to spread in warm, humid environments.</p>
                                <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
                                <p>The head, ears, and forelimbs are the typical sites for skin lesions.
                                    Flaky bald patches with occasionally reddish centres might result from ringworm.
                                    Localized redness or only dandruff may be seen in moderate cases, however more severe infections may spread over the entire body of the cat.
                                    It's also conceivable for a pet to harbour ringworm spores while exhibiting no symptoms at all.</p>

                                <p><b>Definition</b></p>
                                <p>Diabetes in cats is a complicated condition brought on by either a deficiency in the hormone insulin or an insufficient reaction to it. After a cat eats, the digestive system separates the food into different components, including glucose, which insulin then transports to the cells. A cat's blood sugar levels rise when they cannot properly use or make insulin. The end result is hyperglycemia, which, if addressed, can lead to a cat experiencing a wide range of challenging health issues.</p>
                                <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                                <p>This condition can be brought on by aberrant protein deposits in the pancreas, pancreatic illness, specific drugs, and genetics. Obesity, gender (male cats are more likely to develop diabetes than female cats), and age appear to be the main risk factors.</p>
